    <p> Justin Patrick Herbert (born March 10, 1998) is an American football quarterback for the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Oregon Ducks, where he won the 2019 Pac-12 Championship and was named MVP of the 2020 Rose Bowl. He was selected by the Chargers sixth overall in the 2020 NFL Draft. <br> 
        Herbert became the Chargers starting quarterback in the second game of his rookie year after Tyrod Taylor suffered a punctured lung in pre-game. He remained the starter for the rest of the season and set several rookie statistical records, including the most touchdown passes and the most 300-yard games, and was named the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year as a result.</p></h3>
